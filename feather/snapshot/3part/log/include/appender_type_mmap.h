/**
 * @file appender_type_mmap.h
 *
 * @brief Log4c mmap(2) appender interface.
 *
 * The mmap appender uses a fixed length memory mapped file for
 * logging. The appender's name is used as the file name which will be
 * opened and mapped to memory at first use. The memory mapped file is then
 * used as a rotating buffer in which logging events are written.
 *
 * The following examples shows how to define and use mmap appenders.
 * 
 * @code
 *
 * log4c_appender_t* myappender;
 *
 * myappender = log4c_appender_get("myfile.log");
 * log4c_appender_set_type(myappender, &log4c_appender_type_mmap);
 * 
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning the file is not created at first use. It should already exist
 * and have a reasonable size, a mutilple of a page size.
