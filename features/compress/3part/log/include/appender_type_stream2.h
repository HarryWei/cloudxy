/**
 * @file appender_type_stream2.h
 *
 * @brief Log4c stream2 appender interface.
 *
 * The stream2 appender uses a file handle @c FILE* for logging.
 * It can be used with @c stdout, @c stderr or a normal file.
 * It is pretty primitive as it does not do file rotation, or have a maximum
 * configurable file size etc. It improves on the stream appender in a few
 * ways that make it a better starting point for new stream based appenders.
 *
 * It enhances the stream appender by allowing
 * the default file pointer to be used in buffered or unbuffered mode.
 * Also when you set the file pointer stream2 will not attempt to close
 * it on exit which avoids it fighting with the owner of the file pointer.
 * stream2 is configured via setter functions--the udata is
 * not exposed directly.  This means that new options (eg. configure the open
 * mode ) could be added to stream2 while maintaining backward compatability.
 *
 * The appender can be used with default values, for example as follows:
 *
 * @code
 * log4c_appender_t* myappender;
 *
 * myappender = log4c_appender_get("/var/logs/mylog.log");
 * log4c_appender_set_type(myappender,log4c_appender_type_get("stream2"));
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * In this case the appender will  be configured automatically with default 
 * values: 
 * @li the filename is the same as the name of the appender,
 * @c "/var/logs/mymlog.log"
 * @li the file is opened in "w+" mode
 * @li the default system buffer is used (cf; @c setbuf() ) in buffered mode
 *
 * The stream2 appender can be configured by passing it a file pointer
 * to use.  In this case you manage the file pointer yourself--open,
 * option setting, closing.  If you set the file pointer log4c will
 * not close the file on exiting--you must do this:
 * 
 * @code
 * log4c_appender_t* myappender;
 * FILE * fp = fopen("myfile.log", "w");
 *
 * myappender = log4c_appender_get("myappender");
 * log4c_appender_set_type(myappender, log4c_appender_type_get("stream2"));
 * log4c_stream2_set_fp(stream2_appender,myfp);
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * The default file pointer can be configured to use unbuffered mode.
 * Buffered mode is typically 25%-50% faster than unbuffered mode but
 * unbuffered mode is useful if your preference is for a more synchronized 
 * log file:
 *
 * @code log4c_appender_t* myappender;
 *
 * myappender = log4c_appender_get("/var/logs/mylog.log");
 * log4c_appender_set_type(myappender,log4c_appender_type_get("stream2"));
 * log4c_stream2_set_flags(myappender, LOG4C_STREAM2_UNBUFFERED);
 *
 * @endcode
 *
